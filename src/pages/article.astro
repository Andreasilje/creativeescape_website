      <h1>BERLIN'S HIDDEN STREET ART UNIVERSE</h1>
      <h4>Street art in Berlin is more than just pretty walls: it’s a pulse, a voice, and a way to understand the city’s creative spirit, identity, energy, diversity, history, and community.</h4>

      <h2>RAW-Gelände: Industrial Ruins with a Creative Pulse</h2>
      <p>
        In Friedrichshain you’ll find RAW-Gelände, a former railway repair yard that has transformed into a playground for artists, musicians, and alternative projects. Its walls are covered with massive murals, small tags, and quirky installations
        that together create a raw urban collage.
      </p>
      <p>By day, you can wander through the colorful corners, check out small galleries, or grab a coffee at one of the open-air bars. By night, the area comes alive with clubs, concerts, and events.</p>
      <p>What makes RAW-Gelände unique is that art and life exist side by side – it doesn’t feel like a museum, but like a constantly evolving creative hub shaped by the people who use it.</p>

      <h2>Teufelsberg: From Spy Station to Art Mecca</h2>
      <p>
        If you’re up for an adventure outside the city center, head to Teufelsberg, an artificial hill built from World War II rubble. At the top stands an abandoned American listening station from the Cold War, and the place itself is already
        steeped in history.
      </p>
      <p>
        Today, however, the buildings are covered in enormous street art pieces: from vibrant portraits to bold political statements. Walking around feels like exploring a post-apocalyptic art gallery where nature slowly reclaims the concrete
        structures.
      </p>
      <p>Many travelers describe it as one of Berlin’s most unique experiences – a surreal mix of history, sweeping views, and creativity.</p>

      <h2>Why Street Art in Berlin is Different</h2>
      <p>
        Street art in Berlin isn’t just decoration – it’s a voice. Artists use the city’s walls to speak out about social injustice, climate change, freedom, and much more. Unlike in many cities, street art here is often embraced rather than erased,
        which allows both world-famous artists and unknown talents to leave their mark.
      </p>
      <p>
        What makes Berlin special is the constant change: some pieces survive for years, while others are painted over within days. This fleeting quality makes it a living experience, where every walk through the city offers something new to
        discover.
